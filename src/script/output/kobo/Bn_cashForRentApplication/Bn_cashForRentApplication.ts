  // [note] Disclaimer:  With support from the European Union, Danish Refugee Council (DRC) will provide financial assistance to internally displaced people to rent safe and adequate housing. This programme is being implemented in the following regions:  Dnipropetrivska oblast: Zhovty Vody, Kryvyi Rih, Kamyanske, Pavlograd, and Novomoskovsk   Lvivska oblast: Lviv, Stryi and Drohobuch raions. Due to high level of interest, the deadline for applications from Lvivska oblast: Lviv, Stryi and Drohobych raions is 31 August 2023.  Applications received after this date will not be considered.  Other locations will not be considered at this time.  Financial assistance is provided for a period of 6 months and will be paid in two installments: the first installment (for the first three months) within one to two weeks after the application is approved (upon presenting a signed lease agreement), and the second installment (for the next three months) three months after the payment of the first installment. The approval of the second installment will be subject to the applicant meeting the following program criteria:  • DRC employees will be granted access to the leased accommodation.  • The applicant will be able to provide proof of rent payment (bank statement, payment receipt indicating the purpose of the payment, etc.).  Amount of financial support, per month: HH Size  1 - 3 - UAH 6,500                                 4 - UAH 7,000   5+ - UAH 8,500  Example of assistance calculation: A family of four can receive financial assistance for rent in the amount of 7,000 UAH x 3 months = 21,000 UAH (first payment), and 21,000 UAH (second payment).  The following groups are the primary target for cash for rent programme:  • Households which have been displaced from the settlements indicated according to Order of the Ministry of Reintegration of Temporary Occupied Territories of Ukraine dated December 22, 2022 No. 309, or from areas which are regularly under attack and located within 30km of the confrontation lines or border areas with Russia or Belarus. • Households whose home has been significantly damaged (i.e., the level of destruction does not allow living in the house) or destroyed by shelling or other disasters such as flood, wildfire etc., since February 24, 2022. • Newly displaced HH (less than 60 days)  In addition, the household selected must meet at least one of the income criteria outlined below:  • The Household is already renting an apartment but is struggling to meet their other basic needs due to low income, rising rent costs, or other vulnerability factors which may lead to eviction or resorting to negative coping strategies; • The Household has at least one source of income within the household, allowing to cover its basic household needs  • The Household is referred by the Protection team and assistance should be provided even if no known source of income, while referral and follow up is done by the Protection team to identify sustainable solutions  Filling out this application does not guarantee participation in the program. Each application will be considered individually, and a decision will be made on the further participation of the application in the program. The decision is final, and the Danish Refugee Council (DRC) reserves the right to reject any application.
