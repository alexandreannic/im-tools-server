  // [note] In order to register your application, we'd need to ask you a few questions to understand the composition of your household and how to best transfer financial assistance to you if you are eligible. These questions will take between 10-15 minutes. If you are eligible, weâ€™ll need to share some basic details with the bank in order to make the payment. We are also required to share Tax ID numbers of people we provide assistance to with other humanitarian agencies implementing financial assistance programs, to ensure we are not duplicating assistance. All the other information will be stored safely, in accordance with the Law on protection of personal data, and will not be shared outside of DRC and its partners.. Do you provide DRC consent to take photos or copies of your personal documentation at this time? Following DRC Data Protection Protocols and Ukraine Law on Data Protection, we will not share copies or photos of your documents with anyone outside DRC and these will only be used for the sole purpose of processing your information in order to provide you with cash assistance. You can decide to say no at this time and we will need to collect your documents at a later point in time.
